# - A function is like a box, in this box we put code that works together to accomplish some specific task
# The next time we need that code all we have to do is to call the function and the whole code will work like magic

# Declare function:
# def NAME(PARAMETERS/ARGUMENTS):
#     STATEMENTS

# Call function
# NAME()

# The return statement causes function to exit and hand back a value to its caller.
# def foo():
#    return 7

# No. But the real answer is yes. The point of functions in general is to take in inputs and return something. The return statement is used when a function is ready to return a value to its caller.
#Without it, your function returns nothing

# Argument is a specific input in the function
# It is an experssion used when calling the function

# def myfunction(first, second, third):
#     # do something with the 3 variables
#     ...
# myfunction(1, 2, 3)

# from file name that have function import function name
